# common-elemements-in-2-linked-lists
here i have developed a function that takes 2 linked lists as constant arguments, and returns a new linked list that contains every number the two lists have in common.

First, check whether each list has at most only one copy of any number (no duplicate values). If any of the input lists contain a duplicate value, print an error message and return. For an example, the list 3, 5, 6, 7, 3, which has 2 copies of 3, is not allowed.  

Example Output: 

Enter List 1 Values: 3 2 4 9 8 1 10 5

Enter List 2 Values: 10 1 7 6 4 5 9 

Common Values: 1 4 5 9 10
